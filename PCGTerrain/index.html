  <p>Move with the arrow keys, click to change terrain, enter a world seed for a new world.</p>  
  <p>This generator creates natural terrain using Perlin noise and a seed created with the
    xxHash hashing algorithm. Perlin noise is also used to scatter different plants and details,
    as well as the subtle movement of the water. I wanted to create Minecraft-like terrain and
    experimented with laying down different blocks like sand depending on their height/closeness
    to water. Overall, it looks as I intended it to be and I should I continue developing it,
    I want to add more complex generation like biomes and structures.</p>
